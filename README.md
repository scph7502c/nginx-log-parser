# Nginx Log Parser (WIP)

This repository is a **work in progress** project focused on parsing and analyzing server logs with Python.
The first script included here works with **Nginx access logs**, but the repository will be extended with additional
tools and parsers in the future.

## Current Features

- Read Nginx access log line by line
- Extract basic fields:
    - **IP address**
    - **HTTP status code**
- Load configuration from a `.env` file (e.g., log file path)

## Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- Built-in modules: `os`, `pathlib`
- Optional: [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) – for loading `.env` files

## Repository Structure

```text
.
├── nginx_log_parser.py   # current script (WIP)
├── .env                  # config file with log file path (example only)
├── sample.access.log     # sample Nginx log file (for testing)
└── README.md             # documentation
```

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   NGINX_LOG_FILE=./sample.access.log
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

```shell
python nginx_log_parser.py
```

3. Run the script:
   ```shell
   python nginx_log_parser.py
   ```

**Example Output**
IP: 182.44.67.97, Status: 301
IP: 43.157.179.227, Status: 200

## Further development

- Basic Nginx log reader (current)

- Extend parsing (date, request, user agent, referrer, etc.)

- Add filtering and statistics (e.g., 404 errors, most common IPs)

- Implement support for other log formats (Apache, system logs, etc.)

Provide CSV/JSON export functionality
```
